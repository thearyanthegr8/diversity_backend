    "question": "Describe the working of Dijkstra's algorithm. How does it differ from the Bellman-Ford algorithm?",
    "answer": "Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to other nodes in a weighted graph using a priority queue. It assumes non-negative weights. The Bellman-Ford algorithm, however, works with graphs containing negative weights and can detect negative weight cycles, though it has a higher time complexity of O(V*E)."
